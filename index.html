            <p>My name is Shelby Griffith. I am 20 years old and currently in the very beginning phases of building up my music artistry and brand. My current music endeavors are background vocals, and bgv arranging. The musical genres I perform and identify with most are jazz and r&b. I was born and raised in Washington DC and moved to Nola to study music so jazz has always surrounded me. While I am just starting out my professional music career, music has always played a prominent role in my life and happiness. Singing is my truest passion and my goal is to impact listeners with my voice and the story I have to tell, whether that be as simple as making someone’s day a little bit brighter than it was before.</p>

            <h3>Blog Post 1: Starting Out as a Young Professional Musician</h3>
                <p>It's easy to wake up one day and say "I want to be a musician for my career", especially when it's something you've been doing as an extracurricular or hobby for a while now. The possible first step to diving into your musician's journey is figuring out what type of musician you want to be. Do you want to be an artist? If so, do you want to be playing local theaters and smaller shows or do you want to sell out arenas like Beyoncé (completely attainable but it will require a different path than the theater route). Do you want to be a working musician gigging in bands, or by yourself, but in smaller venues doing more shows a week? This is the first step in the process of getting your mind reeling about the possibilities of what your music is. career will hold. And remember, it's ok not to have everything figured out from jump (I sure as heck don't), but this blog serves to provide suggestions and ideas of where to start.<br></br>

                 Now that you've maybe decided which general music career route you want to take, it's time to set both long-term and short-term goals. Now this is a step I struggle with because I, as I'm sure many of my other fellow musicians out here, am a very much go with the flow type of person. This has worked pretty well for me thus far but I also am not necessarily working towards selling out arena's right at this moment. Especially given the fact that I don't have any music released yet. However, if you have specific milestone's you want to achieve as a musician, say for example: one day doing a tiny desk, then gaol setting is going to be a tool that helps you hold yourself accountable and progress as a musician/artist immensely. Set weekly, monthly, yearly goals about your music making and career milestones you'd like to reach by certain times. If you don't reach your goals by your timeline that does not and I mean not mean you've by any means failed or are even set back, it just means you need more time to build yourself up and you'll have a stronger end product as a result. So don't worry :)
